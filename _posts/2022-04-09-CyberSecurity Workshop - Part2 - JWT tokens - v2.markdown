##### JWT tokens:

JSON Web Token is what JWT stands for, it defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed. JWTs can be signed by using a secret or a public/private key pair using RSA.

Many applications use JWT to allow the client to indicate is identity for further exchange after authentication.
For example, if we log in to a website, the website may generate a JWT token for us to maintain our login status. Here is an example of a token.

The token is base64 encoded and consists of three parts: header, claims, signature.

Here is a basic sequence of getting a JWT token:

We can use some decoding tools to decode the JWT token like online tools  https://jwt.io/  or https://token.dev/. We can also use WebWolf  http://localhost:9090/WebWolf/.

Then we can get the following decoded information:

Letâ€™s try JWT signing.
We can choose the role to vote for here. But there is no admin. 
![RUNOOB](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NasTul/COS80013_Lab/main/Picture22.png)
Let's try clicking on the trash can button. Only admin user can reset the votes. 
Then check the developer tools, network tab to see what's happening.

We can see that we have sent our JWT token to the server, as shown in the red line above. Let's decode this data. 
![RUNOOB](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NasTul/COS80013_Lab/main/Picture24.png)
We change the algorithm to none, and the admin information in the data to true as shown below.
![RUNOOB](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NasTul/COS80013_Lab/main/Picture25.png)
Then replace the original JWT token with the generated JWT String. 
Remember to add the last dot. 
Like: eyJhbGciOiJub25lIn0.eyJpYXQiOjE2NDgxODU5NzIsImFkbWluIjoidHJ1ZSIsInVzZXIiOiJUb20ifQ.
If you are using a Firefox browser, then you can modify the token information in the cookie field directly through the Edit and Resend buttons.
However, in chrome you can't do this directly. 
![RUNOOB](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NasTul/COS80013_Lab/main/Picture26.png)
You can do this by right clicking on the network activity and chose the way you want to, for example if you want to send a request using windows terminal, you can choose PowerShell. Then edit the corresponding cookie information in a text editor. Finally, type in the terminal.
